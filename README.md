# Hi👋, My name is Venkata Anil Madapakula
===========================
## 📌 About Me
- **🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist & AI Enthusiast** with a passion for solving real-world problems.  
- **🎓 Data Science Graduate (Class of 2024)** focused on ML, DL, and Data Analytics.  
- **💡 Built projects like Forecasting Food Delivery Time & Human Gender Tracking using AI.**  
- **🤝 Open to collaboration on innovative, data-driven solutions.**  
## 💼 Experience
### **Machine Learning Internship** | Codegnan IT Solutions
**Guntur, Andhra Pradesh** | **Jan 2024 - Apr 2024**
- Developed a **machine learning model** to predict food delivery times by analyzing traffic, distance,
 and order type, optimizing accuracy through algorithm comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost,
 Linear Regression).
- Gained hands-on experience in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation** 
using **Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy**
###  Data Analytics Virtual Internship
**Guntur, Andhra Pradesh** | **Mar 2022 - May 2022**
- I've always had a knack for working with numbers, collecting data, and finding trends and patterns
 that others miss. Being a data analyst is a bit like being a detective—tracking the clues within the
 numbers to find the culprit is always rewarding.
